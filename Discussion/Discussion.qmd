## Differences in C9 and TDP gene modules correlation

### C9

Across cell states, pathology-associated modules converge on several neurobiologically coherent themes:

1. Synaptic dysfunction

postsynaptic specialization

dendritic architecture

dopaminergic synapse

mossy-fiber → CA3 circuit impairment

voltage-gated ion channel activity

These align with well-established signatures of FTLD-C9 involving synaptic weakening and circuit disintegration. [@Starr2018_BrainRes_C9Synaptic]

2. Neuronal metabolic impairment

mitochondrial complex III

aerobic respiration

pyruvate metabolism

Consistent with emerging literature showing mitochondrial collapse downstream of C9orf72-related toxicity. [@Wang2021_CellMetab_C9orf72Mito]

3. Neuroimmune dysregulation

leukocyte and microglial activation

IL-10 pathway regulation

antimicrobial peptide signaling

cytokine binding

Matching known findings that FTLD-C9 evokes aberrant neuroinflammatory programs. [@Lall2017_JCI_C9orf72Microglia]

4. Neurovascular dysfunction

pericyte mitochondrial regulation

ligand-gated channel activity

sensory/chemical detection in vascular cells

glial migration + vascular patterning pathways

Highlighting mechanisms increasingly recognized in C9orf72-related pathology. [@AragonGonzalez2024_FluidsBarriersCNS_BBB]

### TDP

Across cell states, pathology-associated modules converge on key neurobiological mechanisms central to FTLD-TDP:

1. Axonal and cytoskeletal breakdown

impaired axon projection and microtubule organization

disrupted organelle transport

altered membrane potential and vesicle cycling

Reflecting loss of the STMN2-dependent axonal maintenance program. [@Baughn2023_Science_STMN2]

2. Synaptic disintegration

dysfunction of excitatory synapses

impaired pre/post-synaptic architecture

dysregulated GPCR and calcium-channel signaling

Consistent with early circuit-level deficits in FTLD-TDP. [@Cheemala2025_SciAdv_EndothelialTDP43]

3. RNA metabolic failure

compromised splicing, RNA modification, and co-transcriptional processing

loss of chromatin regulatory functions

Paralleling hallmark TDP-43 nuclear loss-of-function. [@Sirkis2019_CurrOpinNeurol_Immunology]

4. Glial reactivity and neuroimmune remodeling

astrocytic and neuronal cytokine signaling

microglia-interacting receptor pathways

leukocyte recruitment and immune effector activation

Matching well-established inflammatory signatures in FTLD-TDP. (https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8025661/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

5. Vascular and neuroimmune signaling disturbances

endothelial and leukocyte adhesion pathways

neuron–vascular cytokine cross-talk

Suggesting neurovascular involvement in the cortical response to TDP-43 pathology. [@Arribas2024_JCIInsight_EndothelialTDP43]
